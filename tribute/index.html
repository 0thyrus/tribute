    <p>
      In the world of civil rights in The United States of America, there is
      only one name that stands out above all others: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
      His determination was unparalleled and his bravery unmatched, which is why
      heâ€™s become an iconic figure in United States history. He spent his life
      fighting for equality between races, a goal that we are still working
      towards to this day.
